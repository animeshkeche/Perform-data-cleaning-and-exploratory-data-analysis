Importing Libraries:

The script begins by importing the necessary libraries: os for operating system functions, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for data visualization.
Setting the Working Directory:

A try-except block is used to read the CSV file named "titanic.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame called data.
If the file is not found, an error message is printed, and the script exits. Any other exceptions are also caught and reported.
Initial Data Exploration:

The first few rows of the DataFrame are displayed using data.head().
Basic statistics of the dataset are generated with data.describe(), and information about the DataFrame (including data types and non-null counts) is retrieved using data.info().
The number of missing values in each column is calculated using data.isnull().sum().
Data Cleaning:

Rows with missing values in the "Embarked" column are dropped from the DataFrame.
Missing values in the "Cabin" column are filled with the string "Unknown".
Missing values in the "Age" column are filled with the mean age of the dataset.
Further Data Validation:

The script checks for any remaining missing values with data.isnull().sum() and identifies any duplicate rows with data.duplicated().sum().
Data Visualization:

A histogram of the "Age" distribution is created using Seaborn's histplot, with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) overlay.
A count plot is generated to visualize survival counts by gender using countplot, with the "Survived" column as the hue.
A scatter plot is created to show the relationship between "Age" and "Fare", colored by the "Survived" status using scatterplot.
